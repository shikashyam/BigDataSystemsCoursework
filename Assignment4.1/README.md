Assignment3
==============================

Assignment 3 for DAMG 7245 

Here we are using the Nowcasting model provided by SEVIR and package it within an API using FastAPI. We will be creating the API end points and making it accessible to our end users which is the NOAA. Within the underlying code in the API, we will use the inputs from the User to find the respective event within the SEVIR database, and then use the nowcasting model to take the 12 images as input and return 12 images as output, which will be stored and the path made available to the user.
